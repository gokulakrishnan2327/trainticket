Here is a sample `README.md` file for setting up your Angular application:

# Angular Ticket Booking System

This is an Angular-based web application for ticket booking. It features a search page where users can select their departure and destination locations, view available trains, and check for class availability and prices. The app uses local JSON files for locations and train data.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- **Node.js** (Recommended version: 14.x or above)
- **Angular CLI** (Recommended version: 15.x or above)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Installing Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
1. Go to the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download and install the latest stable version.
3. Verify installation by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

### Installing Angular CLI
To install Angular CLI globally, run the following command:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Verify the Angular CLI installation:
```bash
ng version
```

## Project Setup

### Clone the Repository
To get started with the project, first, clone this repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokulakrishnan2327/trainticket.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd trainticket
```

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all the required dependencies for the application:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally.

### Start the Development Server
To start the application and run it in the browser, execute the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

This will start a local development server and your application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

Open your browser and navigate to this URL to view the app.

### Running the Application in Production Mode
To build the app for production, run:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will create a `dist/` folder containing the optimized production build of the application. You can then deploy the contents of this folder to your server.

## Folder Structure

Here is the folder structure of the project:

```
/src
  /app
    /search-page
      - search-page.component.ts
      - search-page.component.html
      - search-page.component.css
    /results-page
      - results-page.component.ts
      - results-page.component.html
      - results-page.component.css
    app.component.ts
    app.component.html
    app.module.ts
  /assets
    - locations.json
  /environments
    - environment.ts
    - environment.prod.ts
  index.html
  styles.css
```

- `/app` contains the main components of the application, including the search page and results page.
- `/assets` contains the `locations.json` file, which holds the list of locations and train data.
- `/environments` contains environment files for development and production environments.
- `index.html` is the main entry point for the application.
- `styles.css` contains the global styles for the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular** - Framework for building the application.
- **TypeScript** - Programming language used in the project.
- **RxJS** - Library for handling asynchronous programming.
- **Bootstrap** (optional) - For styling and responsiveness (if used).
- **JSON** - Used for local data storage (locations, train data).
